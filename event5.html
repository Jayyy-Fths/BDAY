      <h2>A Revolution in Banking</h2>
      <p>
        On September 2nd, 1969, the first Automated Teller Machine (ATM) in the United States was introduced, revolutionizing personal banking. 
        Installed at Chemical Bank in Rockville Centre, New York, the ATM offered 24-hour cash withdrawal services, 
        marking the beginning of a new era in financial convenience.
      </p>
      <p>
        This innovation was spearheaded by Don Wetzel, an engineer who envisioned a device that would reduce reliance on bank tellers. 
        The ATM quickly gained popularity, expanding globally and transforming how people manage their money.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, ATMs are indispensable, with millions of machines worldwide facilitating billions of transactions annually. 
        They stand as a testament to technological progress and the relentless pursuit of convenience in everyday life.
