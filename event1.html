      <h2>A Catastrophe That Redefined a City</h2>
      <p>
        The Great Fire of London began on September 2nd, 1666, in the bakery of Thomas Farriner on Pudding Lane. 
        Fanned by strong winds, the fire rapidly engulfed the wooden structures of the medieval city, 
        consuming homes, businesses, and landmarks over four days.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fire destroyed over 13,000 houses, 87 parish churches, and iconic structures like St. Paul's Cathedral. 
        Despite the devastation, the death toll was surprisingly low, with fewer than ten confirmed fatalities, though the true number remains debated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The disaster prompted a massive rebuilding effort led by architects such as Christopher Wren, 
        whose designs transformed London's skyline. The fire also led to significant advancements in fire safety, 
        urban planning, and the modernization of insurance systems. Today, the Great Fire serves as a poignant reminder of resilience and renewal.
