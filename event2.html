      <h2>Founding the Nation's Financial Backbone</h2>
      <p>
        On September 2nd, 1789, the United States Department of the Treasury was officially established, laying the groundwork 
        for the nation's economic infrastructure. The department was tasked with managing federal revenue, overseeing currency 
        production, and regulating economic policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury, played a pivotal role in its success. 
        His visionary policies, including the creation of the national bank and the establishment of a federal mint, 
        helped stabilize the post-Revolutionary War economy and unify the states under a strong financial system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Treasury's influence extends beyond economic managementâ€”it has been integral to the country's growth and survival during wars, 
        economic crises, and periods of reconstruction. The institution remains a cornerstone of U.S. governance to this day.
